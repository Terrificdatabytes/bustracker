**Steps:**
1. Have 3 passengers waiting (P1, P2, P3)
2. Bus becomes full
3. All join queue in order
4. P1 boards (leaves queue)
5. Check P2 and P3 positions

- Queue length updates for all passengers
- FIFO order maintained

---

### Test 10: Priority Queue - Leave Queue

- Queue section disappears
- WebSocket event `leave_priority_queue` is sent
- Queue length updates for remaining passengers

---

### Test 11: Bus Seat Update Broadcast

2. Set different seat counts (BUS-001: 20, BUS-002: 35)
3. Passenger selects stop
4. Observe passenger view

**Expected Results:**
- Passenger sees seat info for closest bus
- Seat counts are different for each bus
- No cross-contamination of data

---

### Test 13: Full Bus Notification

### P2: Concurrent Seat Updates
**Metric:** System handles 10 simultaneous seat updates  
**Target:** All updates processed successfully

### P3: Priority Queue Scalability

## Automated Test Script (Example)

```python
# Example using socketio client library
from socketio import Client

def test_seat_update():
    sio = Client()
    sio.connect('http://localhost:5000')
    
    # Authenticate as driver
    sio.emit('driver_authenticate', {
        'driver_id': 'DRIVER001',
        'password': 'admin123'
    })
    
    # Join route
    sio.emit('join_route', {
        'route_id': '48AC',
        'mode': 'bus',
        'bus_number': 'BUS-001'
    })
    
    # Update seat count
    sio.emit('update_seat_count', {
        'bus_id': 'test_bus',
        'route_id': '48AC',
        'occupied_seats': 30
    })
    
    # Wait for confirmation
    @sio.on('seat_count_updated')
    def on_update(data):
        assert data['occupied_seats'] == 30
        print("âœ“ Seat update test passed")
    
    sio.wait()
```
